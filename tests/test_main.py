"""HTTP-level tests for the Checkpoint 4 routes in app/main.py.

Uses FastAPI's TestClient. The dashboard/health routes never touch the MCP
client, so those stay fast. The report routes do go through the real
MCPToolClient (lazily spawning the app/mcp/server.py subprocess, same as
tests/test_mcp_client.py) since build_report's assembly logic is exactly what
these tests check end-to-end -- slower than a pure unit test (~1-2s each) but
still fully offline. /chat is deliberately NOT exercised here: its logic is
already covered by tests/test_chat.py against a FakeMCPClient, and hitting it
here would additionally load (or attempt to load) the LocalLLMBackend model,
which is unnecessary given the extractive-backend path is what's actually
under test.
